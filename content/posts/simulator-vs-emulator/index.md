## ある人によれば...

> Simulation = For analysis and study

> Emulation = For usage as a substitute

> A simulator is an environment which models but an emulator is one that replicates the usage as on the original device or system.

> Simulator mimics the activity of something that it is simulating. It **"appears"** (a lot can go with this "appears", depending on the context) to be the same as the thing being simulated. For example the flight simulator "appears" to be a real flight to the user, although it does not transport you from one place to another.

> Emulator, on the other hand, **actually "does"** what the thing being emulated does, and in doing so it too "appears to be doing the same thing". An emulator may use different set of protocols for mimicking the thing being emulated, but the result/outcome is always the same as the original object. For example, EMU8086 emulates the 8086 microprocessor on your computer, which obviously is not running on 8086 (= different protocols), but the output it gives is what a real 8086 would give.

## また別の人によれば...

> 1. Simulator is broader than Emulator

> 2. Simulator tends to imitate/model more global processes/things in general with ability to narrow the imitation down (e.g. capacitor simulator with presets representing some known models)

> 3. Emulator tends to imitate certain hardware devices with certain specification, known characteristics and properties (e.g. SNES emulator, Intel 8087 or Roland TB-303)

## 語源を辿ると...

> - emulate is "to be equal" (looks like more aggressive and straightforward - rivalry)
> - simulate is "to be similar" (looks like more sly and tricky - imitation)

## 日本語だと...

- Emulation: （代替可能なレベルでの）模倣
- Simulation: 模擬
